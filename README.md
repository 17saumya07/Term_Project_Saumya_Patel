## Introduction & Business Questions

This project applies predictive analytics techniques to a housing dataset to predict median house values.

Business Questions:
1. Which housing and demographic factors most strongly influence house prices?
2. How accurately can machine learning models predict median house value?
3. Which model performs best in terms of prediction error?


## Limitations & Ethics

This analysis is limited by dataset size and geographic scope.
Ethical considerations include fairness, bias, and responsible model interpretation.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting housing prices, with Random Forest achieving the best performance.
