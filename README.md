## Dataset
- Name: housing.csv
- Source: California Housing Dataset
- Target variable: median_house_value

---

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation and Comparison
6. Interpretation and Insights
